Of course this kind of project seem basic, but in reality they are good for them purpose, learning by practice how to do visual design on webpage using only __html__ and __css__. The class treat also about accessibility, seo purpose, and also __animation__ because yes we can do animation in html/css only and that's allow us to obtain more performance than using a framework for that or javascript.
